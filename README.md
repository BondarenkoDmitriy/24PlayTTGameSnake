# 24PlayTTGameSnake
Implementation of the Classic Snake Game
<br>
<br>
This project showcases a classic Snake game implementation.
<br>
In the game, the snake navigates around the screen, consuming food to gradually increase its size.
<br>
However, if the snake intersects with itself, the game restarts from the beginning.
<br>
Snake control with "arrows up" | "arrows down" | "arrows left" | "arrows right"
<br>
Button "0", returns the default value of the screen
<br>
Rotate the camera 360* by holding the "left mouse button" and rotating the mouse
